While I'd like to name everyone who contributed, the following individuals stand out in particular:\r\n\r\n- [Tom Anderson](https://github.com/TomHAnderson), who contributed the zf-apigility-doctrine module.\r\n- [Julien Guittard](https://github.com/jguittard), who did the UI integration (and much of the Admin API work) for the Doctrine-Connected REST resources, developed the DB Autodiscovery feature, and who was tireless in his testing of the UI integrations.\r\n- [Corentin Larose](https://github.com/corentin-larose), who contributed zf-http-cache.\r\n- [Steve Rhoades](https://github.com/steverhoades), who contributed the PSR-4 support.\r\n- [Enrico Zimuel](https://github.com/ezimuel), who rewrote the UI for 1.1.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/1175734","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/1175734/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/1175734/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.5","id":1175734,"tag_name":"1.0.5","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility

are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apigility 1.0.4!\r\n\r\n- https://apigility.org/download\r\n\r\nThis is our fourth maintenance release of Apigility.\r\n\r\nIBM i Support\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis release contains a number of fixes to ensure the ability to use Apigility on IBM i. Among them:\r\n\r\n- We are pinning support to Zend Framework 2.3.2 and above, which contains updates supporting DB2:\r\n  - Full transaction support.\r\n  - Fixed LIMIT support, allowing for paginated DB result sets.\r\n  - Fixes to database-backed authentication\r\n- The ability to specify database driver options via the Admin UI. Most DB2\r\n  connections need additional driver options specified, and you can now do so via the UI.\r\n\r\nUI Improvements\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nOne lingering issue we've had reported is an error when creating APIs: the UI reports an error, but the API has been created. We made several patches that, in aggregate, should resolve these issues going forward:\r\n\r\n- We discovered that our promise chains in the Admin UI were not optimally constructed, and could potentially raise errors under the appropriate conditions; these have been fixed.\r\n- We introduced comprehensive cache control headers to prevent client-side caching of Admin API calls.\r\n- We introduced a timeout between successful completion of API creation and deletion calls, and subsequent fetching of the API list from the Admin API. In working with [Julien Guittard](https://github.com/jguittard), we were able to find an optimal timeout that resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for those users using Apache to serve the Admin UI and Admin API, we have stopped using backslashes in URI identifiers (Apache rejects URI-encoded slashes by default).\r\n\r\nOther fixes were also made that are detailed under the \"zf-apigility-admin\" header below.\r\n\r\nDocumentation fixes\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nzf-apigility-documentation was not using the correct configuration key to discover input filters, which meant it was not reporting fields at all. This had further implications for zf-apigility-documentation-swagger, which was then unable to expose models based on those fields. This situation is now resolved.\r\n\r\nCollections\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nWhile Apigility has supported retrieving collections in REST services, creating, replacing, updating, or deleting them has been an exercise left to the developer previously. With this release, field definitions can now be used to validate the items passed to collections, giving collections first-class support.\r\n\r\nConsole\r\n-------\r\n\r\nzf-console was extensively updated, with many contributions and ideas from Zend's [Slavey Karadzhov](https://github.com/slaff). These include:\r\n\r\n- Simplification of mapping the command name to the route. By default the command name is considered the first argument of the route now.\r\n- Command handlers may now be specified in the configuration via the `handler` key for a command.\r\n- A number of useful CLI-specific filters are now provided, including an `Explode` filter (split comma or other delimited arguments to an array), a `QueryString` filter (specify arguments in query string format), and a `Json` filter (specify arguments in JSON).\r\n- Better error handling and error reporting.\r\n- The ability to generate autocompletion scripts for your CLI commands.\r\n\r\nzf-console is shaping up as a capable microframework for CLI commands!\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n\r\nMany thanks to everyone who contributed fixes, big or small, towards this release!\r\n\r\nIssues

is our third maintenance release of Apigility, and the first containing security fixes; read on for more information.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fixes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWe were notified by [Stefano Torresi](https://github.com/stefanotorresi) of a potential security vector in `ZF\\Apigility\\DbConnectedResource`. While the `create()` method of that class pulls data from the composed input filter, if present, the `patch()` and `update()` methods were not, making it possible for an attacker to send unwanted data to the API service.\r\n\r\nWe have updated the class to pull from the composed input filter, if present, for each of the `create()`, `patch()`, and `update()` methods.\r\n\r\nIf you use DB-Connected REST resources in Apigility, we **strongly** recommend updating immediately. You can do so by running `composer update` inside your application.\r\n\r\nDeployment Fixes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWe were notified that the logic for finding a Composer executable in [zf-deploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy) would fail in some situations.  A fix was contributed that better resolves the path to the executable, particularly in situations where a `composer.phar` must first be downloaded.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in reviewing this fix, [Enrico Zimuel](https://twitter.com/ezimuel) noted that we needed test coverage for most of the ZFDeploy functionality; we now have a comprehensive set of tests, all passing!\r\n\r\nDocumentation Fixes\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n[Kaloyan Raev](https://github.com/kaloyan-raev) noted that the HTML documentation does not render properly under Internet Explorer, due to the order in which media type selectors are matched. A swap in the order fixes the situation, and continues to work as expected under other browsers.\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Stefano Torresi for working with us on the DB-Connected security issue, to Kaloyan Raev for his assistance with zf-deploy and the documentation, and to Enrico Zimuel, for the huge amount of testing he added to zf-deploy!"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/356999","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/356999/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/356999/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.2","id":356999,"tag_name":"1.0.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility

is our second maintenance release of Apigility, fixing a number of issues, and providing significant improvements for file upload capabilities.\r\n\r\nUpload Support\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nUploads were possible before this release, but were difficult to properly enable. Additionally, PATCH and PUT requests required manually handling the file uploads, as PHP does not natively support file uploads for those request methods; the Zend Framework 2 InputFilter component, because it utilizes PHP's native support for validating that an upload completed and for moving an upload file to a new location, also could not deal with these methods.\r\n\r\nThis release makes the following changes in order to facilitate file uploads via your Apigility API:\r\n\r\n- Content validation was altered to merge file upload data, when present, with the submitted API fields.\r\n- The Admin UI now allows you to mark a field as representing a file upload; this ensures that content validation will work properly, as content validation differs for file uploads.\r\n- The content negotiation module now provides emulation for PHP's file upload support when receiving PATCH and PUT requests, ensuring that the files are uploaded in the same manner, cleaned up post-request, and passed to validation properly. You should notice no difference between POST, PUT, or PATCH requests when performing file uploads, whether a single or multiple files are provided.\r\n\r\nFile uploads are only done using the `multipart/form-data` media type. You will need to add that media type to the content negotiation whitelist if you plan to perform file uploads.\r\n\r\nIf you have further questions, you can [consult the documentation](https://apigility.org/documentation/recipes/upload-files-to-api).\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\nWhile upload support is the major feature of this release, we fixed many other issues.\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n- All repositories have updated `composer.json` files that properly define the two branch aliases for the `master` and `develop` branches.\r\n\r\n- All repositories have updated `README.md` files that provide a \"Requirements\" section linking to the `composer.json` file.\r\n\r\n### zf-apigility-admin\r\n\r\n- [Fixes for the \"Encrypt\" and \"Compress\" filter adapters](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/pull/181), ensuring that these filters can be properly created and configured.\r\n\r\n- [Ability to specify file upload fields](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/pull/182).  A field can now be marked as representing a file upload, ensuring it can then be validated correctly.  - [Fix for unclosed link in authentication screen](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/pull/171), which was preventing edits and saves of authentication details.\r\n\r\n- [Remove charset option for Postgres adapters](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/pull/184), as that adapter does not support setting the character set.\r\n\r\n- [Added DSN to DB adapter input filter](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/pull/185), so that edits to an existing DB adapter will save when the DSN is provided.\r\n\r\n- [Fixes to the DB-Connected service model](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/pull/178), to ensure that update data is saved properly.\r\n \r\n\r\n### zf-apigility-documentation\r\n\r\n- [Fixes HTTP status code for POST operations](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/pull/9), to now display `201` as a potential status.\r\n\r\n### zf-apigility-skeleton\r\n\r\n- [Adds composer.phar to the skeleton](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/pull/63), since it should have always been there!\r\n\r\n### zf-content-negotiation\r\n\r\n- [Implements file uploads](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-negotiation/pull/18) [via request body streaming](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-negotiation/pull/20) for PUT and PATCH requests.\r\n\r\n### zf-content-validation\r\n\r\n- [Ensures file upload data is passed to validation](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-validation/pull/14), which allows validating file uploads.\r\n\r\n### zf-deploy\r\n\r\n- [Ensures --gitignore flag is passed when copying source tree](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy/pull/15).\r\n\r\n### zf-hal\r\n\r\n- [Always store the original entity within ZF\\Hal\\Entity](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-hal/pull/35), fixing an issue where REST controllers cast entities to arrays prior to creating the `ZF\\Hal\\Entity` instance, and thus causing listeners on `renderEntity` et. al. to receive data that could never be matched.\r\n\r\n### zf-oauth2\r\n\r\n- [Pass all OAuth2 adapter options to oauth2-server-php](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2/pull/43), enabling the ability to turn on refresh token re-issue, among other things.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMany thanks for all the great issue reports and discussions on the [mailing list](http://bit.ly/apigility-users) and the various issue trackers!\r\n\r\nWe will do additional maintenance releases on an as-needed basis. The next feature release, 1.1, is in development, and includes:\r\n\r\n- Doctrine-Connected REST services\r\n- Database Autodiscovery for REST services (think of this as DB-Connected that finds all your tables and proposes field configuration for you!)\r\n- Mongo-Connected REST services\r\n- HTTP Caching\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate any feedback you can provide, either in the mailing lists, in issues, or via comments on associated pull requests.\r\n\r\nStay tuned!"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/320328","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/320328/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/320328/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.1","id":320328,"tag_name":"1.0.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility

are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apigility 1.0.1!\r\n\r\nThis is our first maintenance release of Apigility, and features a number of bugfixes reported since the initial release.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\n- **zf-content-negotiation**\r\n  - Removed a conditional in `ZF\\ContentNegotiation\\JsonModel` that could never\r\n    be reached, and which was redundant with the parent class.\r\n    ([#17](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-negotiation/issues/17))\r\n- **zf-apigility-skeleton**\r\n  - Added a footer and favicon to the default layout.\r\n    ([#60](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/pull/60))\r\n- **zf-apigility-admin**\r\n  - Fixed a refresh issue with new RPC services.\r\n    ([#159](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/159))\r\n  - Fixed a rendering issue in the navbars when on small screens.\r\n    ([#162](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/162))\r\n  - Ensured the `<base href>` for the admin UI uses a fully-qualified URI,\r\n    including scheme, host, and port, to ensure assets may be resolved\r\n    cross-platform.\r\n    ([#164](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/164))\r\n  - Added config information for the `zend_datacache.apc-compatibility` INI\r\n    setting to the \"disable your cache\" modal.\r\n    ([#165](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/165))\r\n  - Ensured the `entity_identifier_name` and `hydrator_name` configuration\r\n    settings in `db-connected` configuration are properly synced on updates to\r\n    DB-Connected REST services.\r\n    ([#166](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/166))\r\n  - Ensured that togglable filter option values are saved correctly.\r\n    ([#167](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/167))\r\n  - Ensured that available options for the `DateTimeFormatter` (and several\r\n    others) are propagated to the Admin UI.\r\n    ([#168](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/168))\r\n  - Added a footer, favicon, and a number of documentation links to the Admin\r\n    UI.\r\n    ([#169](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/169))\r\n  - Ensured that the `collection_name` REST setting can be updated from the Admin\r\n    UI and API.\r\n    ([#170](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/170))\r\n\r\nChanges to Composer configuration\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nA user noted that we had two `branch-alias` sections in each repository. While this did not lead to invalid configuration, it did mean that the latter took precedence of the former, meaning that the only \"development\" alias we had for mapping the development branch to future 1.1 releases. All repositories have been updated with the 1.0.1 release to fix this situation; all sections now read as the following:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"extra\": {\r\n        \"branch-alias\": {\r\n            \"dev-master\": \"1.0-dev\",\r\n            \"dev-develop\": \"1.1-dev\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitch to SSL\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n[apigility.org](https://apigility.org) was originally served over HTTP. However, with the addition of the installer script, we felt it was important to serve the site over SSL. We were not able to do this in time for the 1.0.0 release, but put the functionality in place by the end of last week. Any previous link will now perform a permanent redirect to the SSL version of the site.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMany thanks for all the great issue reports and discussions on the [mailing list](http://bit.ly/apigility-users)!

Server side applications that return heavy loads of HTML markup are waning; instead APIs are driving the web. APIs are being used to enable inter-division data exchange. APIs are being used as the building blocks for web applications -- allowing user interface experts the flexibility to change the look and feel of a website with no intervention from the server-side application developers. APIs are driving and empowering the mobile web, allowing creation of both native mobile applications and mobile web applications.\r\n\r\nApigility exists to allow _you_ to expose _your_ business logic as an API.\r\n\r\nOpinionated\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nAPIs are not just about tossing around some JSON or XML. They require a ton of architectural decisions every step of the way as you implement the API:\r\n\r\n- How will you handle HTTP method negotiation?\r\n- How will you handle content negotiation?\r\n- How will you handle authentication?\r\n- How will you handle authorization?\r\n- How will you handle input validation?\r\n- What representation format will you use?\r\n- How will you represent errors?\r\n- How will you document your API?\r\n\r\nMost of these questions have no single, correct answer. Many standards, proposals, and drafts exist for all aspects of APIs. As a developer, you have to wade through them and choose which you will use, and how you will put them together.\r\n\r\nIn short, when developing an API, you often spend an equal or greater amount of time developing the architecture for the API as you would writing the code you want to expose in the first place.\r\n\r\nApigility is opinionated _for you_, and provides a flexible and robust engine that answers these questions:\r\n\r\n- [application/hal+json](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06) is\r\n  used for the representation format (but you can add your own representations\r\n  if you really want).\r\n- [application/problem+json](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-06)\r\n  is used for representing errors.\r\n- HTTP method negotiation is handled early, returning appropriate response\r\n  status codes and headers when invalid methods are detected. Support for\r\n  `OPTIONS` requests is built in.\r\n- Content negotiation is handled early, returning appropriate response\r\n  status codes and headers when we cannot return an appropriate representation,\r\n  or cannot understand the data provided to the application.\r\n- Authentication is handled early, returning appropriate response\r\n  status codes and headers when invalid credentials are detected. We provide\r\n  HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, and OAuth2 support out-of-the-box, but provide a\r\n  flexible, event-driven system for implementing or integrating your own\r\n  authentication systems.\r\n- Authorization is handled early, returning appropriate response\r\n  status codes and headers when access is not allowed. We provide an ACL-based\r\n  system that can be easily extended to provide user-specific permissions as\r\n  well as an event-driven system for implementing or integrating your own\r\n  authorization systems if needed.\r\n- Input validation is handled early, returning appropriate response status codes\r\n  and error messages when invalid data is detected.\r\n- Documentation is provided out of the box. We provide HTML, JSON, and\r\n  [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) representations; we\r\n  anticipate adding more in the future. Documentation is generated automatically\r\n  from your API configuration, and you are able to add descriptions and more\r\n  detail as desired.\r\n\r\nWe make decisions so you don't have to. However, you'll note that we've created flexibility so that if _you_ have an opinion, you can integrate it!\r\n\r\nInterface with your API\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nApigility is not just an engine. Apigility also provides a web-based Admin UI to allow you to quickly create and modify your API and services, set up authentication, create authorization rules, set up validations for incoming data, and write document.\r\n\r\nThe Admin UI is built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and is backed by... an API! (We're taking the \"API First\" mantra very seriously!)\r\n\r\nGet Started in Seconds\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nYou can install Apigility in seconds; execute the following command in your shell:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ curl -sS http://apigility.org/install | php\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, if you don't have [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) installed, use the PHP interpreter itself:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ php -r \"readfile('http://apigility.org/install');\" | php\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeploy Anywhere\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nApigility is built on top of Zend Framework 2, and has tools to ensure that the Admin UI is only present in development mode. As such, you can deploy Apigility anywhere you normally deploy PHP applications: a local server, your web host provider, or the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe provide a tool, [ZFDeploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy), to aid in creating deployment packages, including Zend Server ZPK files.\r\n\r\nModular\r\n-------\r\n\r\nApigility consists of more than a dozen Zend Framework 2 modules, each doing one specific task in the workflow. As such, you can mix and match these modules in your own ZF2 applications, or even [add Apigility to an existing application](http://apigility.org/documentation/recipes/apigility-in-an-existing-zf2-application).\r\n\r\nThe Future\r\n----------\r\n\r\nReaching 1.0 is a huge milestone -- but it's not the end of the road!\r\n\r\nWe already have a number of great features waiting in the wings for a 1.1 release: Doctrine-Connected services, Database Autodiscovery, Mongo-Connected services, and HTTP Caching.\r\n\r\nWhat will _you_ build today?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/297414","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/297414/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/297414/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta3","id":297414,"tag_name":"1.0.0-beta3","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility

is our third -- and likely last! -- beta release of Apigility! The features in this release are mainly around stabilization.\r\n\r\nDeployment and Console\r\n----------------------\r\nMost of the work we've performed since beta2 was on [zf-deploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy), our packaging/deployment tool. We made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- First, the tool can now be used both within an application, as well as a\r\n  standalone [phar](http://php.net/phar) file. When used as a standalone phar\r\n  file, you can now self update it with the `self-update` command; this will\r\n  check https://packages.zendframework.com/ for any new versions, and, if found,\r\n  do an \"in-place\" update of the tool. (Note: the library we use that provides\r\n  this functionality often emits PHP fatal errors; in practice, however, we've\r\n  noticed that the process works even when such errors are reported.)\r\n- Second, we were not happy with the argument handling we were using, nor with\r\n  the strong coupling of console argument parsing logic with the logic consuming\r\n  the arguments. We built a small microframework around `Zend\\Console`'s\r\n  `RouteMatcher` subcomponent that provides more flexibility around argument\r\n  handling, and are now shipping this in the module\r\n  [zf-console](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-console).\r\n\r\nIn addition to these architectural changes, we also implemented two new features in the tool:\r\n\r\n- You can specify a directory with the \"local\" configuration you want to use in\r\n  the deployment package via the `--configs` argument.\r\n- You can specify a directory containing the ZPK skeleton you wish to use when\r\n  creating a ZPK (Zend Server deployment package); this directory should contain\r\n  a `deployment.xml` and any scripts you will be using.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, we feel that `zf-deploy` is ready for inclusion in a stable Apigility release!\r\n\r\nDocumentation Updates\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWe've received a number of documentation improvements since beta2, and added a few documents as well.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n\r\n- An error was spotted in the \"HAL for RPC services\" recipe that made the code\r\n  unusable.\r\n- We've documented how to use the Zend Server SDK to deploy ZPK packages.\r\n- We've added a recipe for adding Apigility modules to an existing Zend\r\n  Framework 2 application.\r\n- We've added documentation on the new `zf-console` module.\r\n\r\nBeta3 Updates\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIn addition to the deployment and console tooling, we made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- We updated the `SendResponse` listener in `zf-api-problem` to merge in any\r\n  headers set in the application response object before sending the API Problem\r\n  response. This ensures that any previously set headers are also set -- solving\r\n  several issues observed when using third-party modules for Cross Origin\r\n  Resource Sharing (CORS), as well as HTTP authentication.\r\n- The storage adapters we ship with `zf-oauth` now both allow you to specify\r\n  configuration via a `storage_settings` key; this change allows you to specify\r\n  custom tables for both the PDO and Mongo adapters.\r\n- We've updated the \"api.enable\" service to ensure it works with current\r\n  versions of Apigility (and no longer raises errors!).\r\n- We no longer display a resource class in the \"Source Code\" tab of a service if\r\n  a corresponding class does not exist (e.g., DB-Connected resource classes are\r\n  virtual services).\r\n- We've added the option to recursively delete the directory for a service to\r\n  the Admin API; the Admin UI now presents a checkbox with this option.\r\n- We've added the option to delete an entire API. By default, this only removes\r\n  the API's module from application configuration; however, you have the option\r\n  to recursively delete the API module as well (once again presented in the\r\n  Admin UI via a checkbox).\r\n- We now generate factories for RPC controllers and REST resource classes when\r\n  creating new services. This simplifies the story for dependency injection of\r\n  these classes.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAt this time, we feel Apigility has become very stable, and that we have addressed the most pressing usability issues. We anticipate issuing a stable release next week (week of 5 May 2014).\r\n\r\nAs noted in previous beta announcements, reaching stability is only the first step, however! Features such as \"Doctrine-Connected\", \"Mongo-Connected\", and \"DB-Autodiscovery\" REST services are already either implemented or will be soon, and we will be debuting these in a 1.1 version in the very near future.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/275254","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/275254/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/275254/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.0beta2","id":275254,"tag_name":"1.0.0beta2","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility Version 1.0.0beta2","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2014-04-16T17:38:14Z","published_at":"2014-04-16T18:04:56Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/116339","id":116339,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta2.tgz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":4598937,"download_count":115,"created_at":"2014-04-16T18:04:15Z","updated_at":"2014-04-16T18:04:56Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/1.0.0beta2/zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta2.tgz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/116338","id":116338,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta2.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":8000849,"download_count":470,"created_at":"2014-04-16T18:04:15Z","updated_at":"2014-04-16T18:04:56Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/1.0.0beta2/zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta2.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/1.0.0beta2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/1.0.0beta2","body":"Documentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the beta phase for the Zend Framework team is documenting\r\nthe project. We've made enormous headway at this point, but we'll let **you** be\r\nthe judge of that; [visit the documentation yourself](http://apigility.org/documentation)!\r\n\r\nAmong topics covered:\r\n\r\n- A \"Getting Started\" guide, and a companion, \"REST Service Tutorial\".\r\n- An API Primer\r\n- Chapters on Authentication/Authorization, Content Validation, and the\r\n  Documentation features.\r\n- A module-by-module reference guide, detailing configuration options.\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWhile the beta cycle is primarily around stabilizing the API and Admin UI, we\r\ndecided one new feature warranted inclusion in version 1: a packaging/deployment\r\ntool, [zf-deploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy).\r\n\r\nThis tool allows you to create packages from your Apigility -- or any ZF2\r\napplication -- for deployment. Formats supported include zip, tar, tgz, and zpk\r\n(the Zend Server deployment package format). We plan to integrate support for\r\ndeploying zpk packages soon as well.\r\n\r\nBeta2 Updates\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nPolishing, polishing, polishing was our mantra for beta2. This included\r\nincorporating user feedback, but also scrutinizing the UI and code for\r\nconsistency issues.\r\n\r\n### UI Updates\r\n\r\nFollowing beta1, we had a number of complaints about UI responsiveness,\r\nparticularly around the \"Fields\" screen. We did some analysis of the UI, and a\r\nlot of work around dynamically loading and unloading DOM in the admin based on\r\nwhat should be visible. As a result, we were able to significantly improve\r\nresponsiveness. There may be more work to do, but early reports indicate that\r\nthe changes make the Admin UI usable in situations that previously crashed the\r\nbrowser.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the performance improvements, we made the following updates:\r\n\r\n- On the \"Authorizations\" screen for each API, if no authentication is currently\r\n  configured, we display a message to this effect, and link to the\r\n  authentication screen. Unfortunately, in beta1, that link was invalid; we've\r\n  fixed this.\r\n\r\n- The \"Fields\" tab received a slight overhaul. We noticed that items with\r\n  toggles displayed \"Yes/No\" terminology, but \"On/Off\" for the actual form\r\n  input; these now use \"Yes/No\" verbiage consistently. The \"Help\" screen could\r\n  not be dismissed with the `<Esc>` key; it now can. Previously, when hitting\r\n  `<Enter>` from the \"Create New Field\" text input, it would raise the \"Help\"\r\n  screen; it now properly creates the new field. The \"Description\" field was\r\n  moved to the first option displayed for each field, to promote documentation\r\n  of fields. We also added a \"Validation Failure Message\" field to allow\r\n  specifying a unified error message on failed validation (vs. one or more per\r\n  validator); we also ensured that \"blanking\" out the data in this field will\r\n  remove any such message previously set. Finally, filters are now listed before\r\n  validators, to signal the order in which validation operations occur\r\n  (filtering/normalization occurs before validation).\r\n\r\n- The \"Source Code\" tab was not properly generating links for files; we've fixed\r\n  this in beta2.\r\n\r\n### Engine Updates\r\n\r\nA few improvements were made to the API engine itself:\r\n\r\n- The `UnauthorizedListener` registered by the `zf-apigility` module was not\r\n  registering headers set by the `zf-mvc-auth` module, meaning that the\r\n  `WWW-Authenticate` header was not propagating. This has been corrected.\r\n\r\n- We modified `ZF\\ContentNegotiation\\JsonModel` to check for `json_encode()`\r\n  errors, and to raise an exception when one is detected. This prevents\r\n  situations where an empty response is returned on inability to serialize to\r\n  JSON.\r\n\r\n- `zf-apigility-documentation-swagger` was not returning a `Content-Type` header\r\n  value of `application/vnd.swagger+json`; it now does.\r\n\r\n- We fixed the bcrypt cost in `zf-oauth2` to use the defaults from `Zend\\Crypt`.\r\n\r\n- We updated the OAuth2 database schema in `zf-oauth2` to match that of the\r\n  upstream [oauth2-server-php package](https://github.com/bshaffer/oauth2-server-php).\r\n\r\n- We now inject the `ZF\\Rest\\ResourceEvent` with the current MVC request object;\r\n  you can retrieve it from within your resource class using\r\n  `$this->getEvent()->getRequest()`. This will give you access to HTTP request\r\n  headers, query string arguments, etc.\r\n\r\n- We no longer allow multiple \"self\" relational links in `zf-hal`.\r\n\r\n- When specifying route parameters for a `zf-hal` metadata map, you can now use\r\n  a PHP callable as the value; `zf-hal` will invoke that callable with the\r\n  object for which a link is being generated in order to get the value for that\r\n  route parameter. This is particularly useful for deterimining identifiers for\r\n  parent resources.\r\n\r\n- We moved the `zf-apiglity-welcome` requirement to be a development-only\r\n  requirement.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/238660","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/238660/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/238660/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/1.0.0beta1","id":238660,"tag_name":"1.0.0beta1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility Version 1.0.0beta","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2014-03-21T21:17:17Z","published_at":"2014-03-24T20:33:32Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/100061","id":100061,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta1.tgz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":19103345,"download_count":232,"created_at":"2014-03-24T20:44:24Z","updated_at":"2014-03-24T20:44:54Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/1.0.0beta1/zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta1.tgz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/100104","id":100104,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta1.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":22706007,"download_count":21353,"created_at":"2014-03-24T20:45:40Z","updated_at":"2014-03-24T20:46:14Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/1.0.0beta1/zf-apigility-skeleton-1.0.0beta1.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/1.0.0beta1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/1.0.0beta1","body":"This is the first beta release for Apigility. From this point forward, we will\nbe keeping backwards compatibility between versions. New features will be\ntargetted for version 1.1.0, with bugfixes and security fixes targetted for the\nupcoming stable release and any subsequent maintenance releases.\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\nAll Apigility modules were updated to use a [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/psr-4-autoloader/psr-4-autoloader.md)\nstructure and autoloader. This flattens the packages significantly, and also\nallows simplification of the PHPUnit test runner. A PSR-4 variant of the ZF2\n`StandardAutoloader`, `ZF\\Apigility\\Autoloader`, was created to provide true\nPSR-4 autoloading, including the ability to have underscores (`_`) in class\nnames, which has been a common feature request. ZF2 `Module` classes created for\nnew API modules now use the new autoloader for loading classes inside the\nmodule.\n\nAll modules were added to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), giving us continuous integration going\nforward.\n\nWith the release of Zend Framework 2.3.0, we were able to update the ZF2\ndependency to remove the `-dev` stability marker; this also means that packages\nshould start to be smaller, as we'll be able to use distribution versions of ZF2\ngoing forward instead of git clones.\n\nAdditionally, the following features were added:\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-content-validation#8](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-validation/issues/8) adds the ability to provide HTTP method-specific input\n  filters. This feature is not yet integrated into the Apigility Admin UI, but\n  can be configured manually. To do so, add method/input filter service name\n  pairs for the given controller service name; if no method-specific input\n  filter exists, zf-content-validation will fallback to the `input_filter` key,\n  if defined. As an example:\n\n    'zf-content-validation' => array(\n        'Example\\V1\\Rest\\Status\\Controller' => array(\n            // This is the fallback input filter, and the one the UI\n            // can define and manipulate:\n            'input_filter' => 'Example\\V1\\Rest\\Status\\Validator',\n            // This one will be used on POST requests only:\n            'POST' => 'Example\\V1\\Rest\\Status\\NewStatusValidator',\n        ),\n    ),\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-mvc-auth#20](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-mvc-auth/issues/20)\n  provides a patch that injects the `MvcEvent` with a new key,\n  `ZF\\MvcAuth\\Identity`. You can pull the discovered identity from this event\n  parameter now. Additionally, in REST resources, calling `$this->getIdentity()`\n  will retrieve the identity.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#124](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/124) and\n  [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#129](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/129)\n  provide initial input filters for all Apigility Admin API services, as well as\n  UI integration for reporting errors. All validation errors are caught and\n  reported in a single dialog within the form that raises them.\n\n- The 'edit settings' screen for REST services now allows editing the entity\n  class and collection class names.\n\n- The 'API Overview' page now links services to their overviews. The service\n  description is displayed beneath each service; if not yet defined, a link to\n  the 'edit documentation' tab for the service is provided.\n\n- A new modal will be displayed to users of the Apigility Admin UI if the API\n  detects that the filesystem is not writable. The modal details what changes\n  need to be made in order for the UI and API to work correctly.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-oauth2#30](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2/issue/30) splits\n  out initialization of the `oauth2-server-php` server from the `zf-oauth2`\n  controller, allowing the ability to replace it, write a delegator for it, etc.\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-content-validation#10](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-validation/issues/10)\n  changes the key used by the `InputFilterAbstractServiceFactory` from\n  `input_filters` to `input_filter_specs`. This is due to the fact that ZF 2.3.0\n  introduces an `InputFilterManager`, which is already consuming the key\n  `input_filters`. Wrapped in this change is the fact that the\n  `InputFilterAbstractServiceFactory` is now registered as an abstract service\n  factory with the `InputFilterManager`, instead of with the application service\n  manager instance.\n\n  For those updating their Apigility libraries to 1.0.0beta1, edit your\n  `module.config.php` files to rename the `input_filters` key to\n  `input_filter_specs`.\n\n- The `zf-configuration` controller `ZF\\Configuration\\Controller` was moved into\n  `zf-apigility-admin`. This URI for the service remains the same, but the\n  controller itself has moved. (This change was done to consolidate all Admin\n  API controllers in the same module, as well as to reduce the dependencies\n  needed in the `zf-configuration` component.)\n\nFixes\n-----\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#115](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/115) - Ensures\n  that non-SQLite PDO OAuth2 adapters may be provided without error.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#117](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/117) - Ensure\n  that the `route_match` is passed to the API when saving an RPC service.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#118](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/118) - Ensure\n  that the Content Negotiation `selector` is passed to the API correctly when\n  saving an RPC service.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#120](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/120) - Remove\n  duplicate call to initialize the `ServerUrl` helper.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#122](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/122) and\n  [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#123](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/123) - Add checks\n  for array keys before accessing them when building the documentation graph for\n  a given service operation.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#126](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/126) - Updates \n  the admin to pass the `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag in order to provide Internet\n  Explorer compatibility.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#132](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/132) - Ensures\n  that authorization data is fetched each time a new service is created, a\n  service is updated, or a service is deleted, ensuring the table reflects the\n  current list of available services and HTTP methods.\n\n- [zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin#133](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/issues/133) - Updates\n  the 'angular-flash' functionality to anchor flash messages to the bottom of\n  the window. Additionally, any error flash messages now have a 'close' button,\n  requiring user intervention for dismissal.\n\n- Many fixes were made to the UI to improve performance, remove UI refresh\n  errors, provide more consistent color schemes, ensure tabs stay focussed\n  between state transitions, etc.\n\n- The Apigility Admin API was updated to break the authentication service into\n  more granular sub-services, one for each type of authentication supported.\n  This simplifies validation, and allows for future expansion.\n\n- Work was done to ensure opcode cache detection is as solid as possible. We now\n  properly distinguish between APC and APCu, allowing the latter to be enabled\n  when using the Admin API.\n\n- `zf-apigility-documentation` was not correctly aggregating RPC documentation;\n  this has been fixed.\n\n- We reviewed the various events triggered to ensure that they were happening in\n  the correct order, which we defined as:\n\n  - Authentication\n  - HTTP method negotiation (is the method called allowed for the service?)\n  - Authorization (is the discovered identity allowed to perform the requested\n    action?)\n  - Content Negotiation (determine incoming Content-Type and marshal data from\n    request body; determine if Accept and/or Content-Type are valid for the\n    request)\n  - Content Validation\n\n  Several event listener priorities were updated to fit the above requirements.\n  A new listener, `ZF\\Rest\\Listener\\OptionsListener`, was introduced to handle\n  HTTP method negotiation for REST services, and is registered at the same\n  priority as the RPC `OptionsListener` (which previously existed).\n\n- `zf-configuration` was updated to never write configuration using short-array\n  notation; this was done to ensure compatibility of generated configuration\n  with PHP 5.3 (as developers may use the admin API via 5.4, but deploy to 5.3)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/205737","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/205737/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/205737/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/0.9.1","id":205737,"tag_name":"0.9.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Apigility Version 0.9.1","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2014-03-01T17:57:53Z","published_at":"2014-03-01T18:20:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/84527","id":84527,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.9.1.tgz","label":"","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":115645142,"download_count":355,"created_at":"2014-03-01T18:13:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-01T18:20:42Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/0.9.1/zf-apigility-skeleton-0.9.1.tgz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/84528","id":84528,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.9.1.zip","label":"","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":121077265,"download_count":1040,"created_at":"2014-03-01T18:13:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-01T18:20:42Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/0.9.1/zf-apigility-skeleton-0.9.1.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/0.9.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/0.9.1","body":"Fixes two critical issues in authentication/authorization reported against\r\n0.9.0:\r\n\r\n- [zfcampus/zfoauth2#27](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2/issues/27)\r\n  reported an inability to save OAuth2 adapter details from the Apigility admin\r\n  UI.

We still recommend **5.4.8** for serving the admin user interface.\r\n\r\n- New modules, [zf-apigility-documentation](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation) and\r\n  [zf-apigility-documentation-swagger](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger),\r\n  providing documentation visualizations of APIs created with Apigility. The\r\n  base module provides both JSON and HTML visualizations via the URI\r\n  `/apigility/documentation`, based on the Accept header value present.\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation-swagger provides an additional JSON visualization\r\n  for the mediatype `application/vnd.swagger+json`, for seeding a [Swagger\r\n  UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) installation; additionally, it\r\n  provides the Swagger UI via `/apigility/swagger`.\r\n\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation is enabled by default in zf-apigility-skeleton;\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation-swagger is an opt-in module.\r\n\r\n- **The `/admin` and `/welcome` routes are now removed!** The admin UI now uses\r\n  `/apigility/ui`, and the welcome screen uses `/apigility/welcome`. New routes\r\n  for documentation are also available, as detailed above.\r\n\r\n- A new module was created for Apigility-specific interfaces,\r\n  [zf-apigility-provider](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-provider).\r\n  The primary use case is for composition in modules that may or may not be\r\n  consumed by Apigility (e.g., a general-purpose module that could be composed\r\n  into many projects). The only interface currently is\r\n  `ZF\\Apigility\\Provider\\ApigilityProviderInterface`, which replaces\r\n  `Zend\\Apigility\\ApigilityModuleInterface` (and thus prevents the necessity of\r\n  installing all Apigility modules just to implement the interface!).\r\n\r\n- A new module was introduced for handling development mode, \r\n  [zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode);\r\n  this is a fork of [NFDevelopmentMode](https://github.com/19ft/NFDevelopmentMode),\r\n  which was based off the equivalent functionality in zf-apigility-skeleton's\r\n  `Application` module. We removed the functionality from the skeleton, and\r\n  added a dependency on the new module.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-skeleton's layout was updated to match that of the admin UI.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-admin received numerous updates:\r\n    - Ability to add documentation of services, fields, and operations.\r\n\r\n    - Ability to use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) when configuring an\r\n      OAuth2 authentication adapter.\r\n\r\n    - Ability to inspect, add, configure, and delete zf-content-negotiation\r\n      selectors.\r\n\r\n    - Links to HTML documentation of APIs managed by the Apigility instance\r\n      (more on this below).\r\n\r\n    - Ability to create and manipulate filter chains for each field in a\r\n      service.\r\n\r\n    - (Limited) detection of whether or not an opcode cache is enabled; if\r\n      detected, a modal dialog will be presented to the end-user detailing how\r\n      to disable it.\r\n\r\n    - Completely overhauled and refactored admin UI application to ease\r\n      maintenance and feature additions. The admin UI now uses\r\n      [Bower](http://bower.io) for managing UI asset dependencies, and\r\n      [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for building the UI distribution. We have\r\n      dropped ng-route for the [angular-ui\r\n      ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), providing us with\r\n      more flexibility in UI implementation and layout. All services,\r\n      controllers, and directives have been moved into their own files.\r\n\r\n    - Countless UI/UX improvements.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-welcome has been updated to use the Apigility \"Rocket ElePHPant\"\r\n  logo for the splash screen, and to provide buttons to the HTML and Swagger\r\n  documentation, if the appropriate modules are available.\r\n\r\n- **zf-rest and zf-rpc now each store a `service_name` key in the configuration\r\n  for each service.** While efforts have been made to ensure existing\r\n  configuration still works, we recommend adding this key to each service. The\r\n  value should be the short name representation for the service, usually the\r\n  name you provided when creating the service.\r\n\r\n- **All repositories have been updated to make a clean distinction between the\r\n  terms \"Entity\", \"Collection\", and \"Resource\".** An \"Entity\" is anything\r\n  addressable via a URI containing a unique identifier. A \"Collection\" is any\r\n  URI that returns a set of entities. A \"Resource\" refers to a URI that may\r\n  return collections and/or entities. As such, we have several BC breaks:\r\n\r\n    - The event `renderResource` is now `renderEntity`.\r\n\r\n    - The event `renderCollection.resource` is now `renderCollection.entity`.\r\n\r\n    - `ZF\\Hal\\Resource` was renamed to `ZF\\Hal\\Entity`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource` in the zf-mvc-auth configuration is now `entity`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_http_methods` in zf-rest is now\r\n      `entity_http_methods`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_class` in zf-rest is now `entity_class`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_identifier_name` in zf-rest is now\r\n      `entity_identifier_name`. (This change only affects those who have been\r\n      using latest master, but have not updated since late-January 2014.)\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `identifier_name` in zf-apigility `db-connected` configuration\r\n      is now `entity_identifier_name`;\r\n\r\n- zf-hal now properly differentiates between the identifier used in the route\r\n  definition, and the identifier used for the entity; this allows you to use one\r\n  value on the uri -- e.g., `status_id` -- and another in your entity class --\r\n  e.g., `id`. zf-hal will fallback to the `route_identifier_name` if no\r\n  `entity_identifier_name` is present.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility, when detecting an input filter is present, will pull values from\r\n  the input filter, and not use any other values even if provided in the\r\n  request. This prevents SQL errors due to unknown columns.\r\n\r\n  Additionally, zf-apigility's assets were updated, and a Grunt + Bower\r\n  toolchain provided for keeping them up-to-date.\r\n\r\n- zf-rest, when detecting an input filter is present for the current request,\r\n  will inject it into the `ResourceEvent`, allowing developers to retrieve it\r\n  via `$this->getEvent()->getInputFilter()`. \r\n\r\n  Additionally, support for `patchList` was added to the\r\n  `AbstractResourceListener`.\r\n\r\n- zf-api-problem was updated to match [Problem\r\n  API draft 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-05).\r\n  This has changed the internal structure and JSON representation of problem\r\n  results. If you were manipulating `ApiProblem` objects directly previously,\r\n  you may need to alter your code.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/0.8.0","id":128739,"tag_name":"0.8.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.8.0","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:30:20Z","published_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/51453","id":51453,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":97823152,"download_count":240,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:44:20Z","updated_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/0.8.0/zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/51454","id":51454,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":103633178,"download_count":1880,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:48:43Z","updated_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/0.8.0/zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/0.8.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/0.8.0","body":"Adds content validation support.\r\n\r\n- **Ups minimum supported PHP version to 5.4.8**.\r\n- New module, zf-content-validation, which allows associating ZF2 input filters\r\n  with named controller services, as well as creation of named input filters via\r\n  a ZF2 abstract service factory.
