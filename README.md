Creating a new release
----------------------

Use the `Makefile`:

```console
$ make all VERSION=<version string>
```

This will update:

- `config/autoload/global.php`
- `data/releases.json`
- `composer.phar` (if out-of-date)
- `composer.lock` (if the documentation was updated)

Spot-check those, commit, and push.

Updating 3rd Party UI Dependencies
----------------------------------

We use [Bower](http://bower.io) for managing 3rd party UI dependencies. If you
need to update or add dependencies, make sure you have installed Bower first.

To add a dependency:

```console
$ bower install <name> -S
```

Once installed and integrated, add the new directory under
`public/bower_components` and the `bower.json` file, and commit.

To update dependencies:

```console
$ bower update <name>
```

As with installing dependencies, after testing the updated version, add the
updated directory under `public/bower_components` and the `bower.json` file, and
commit.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is written in a separate repository,
[apigility-documentation](https://github.com/zfcampus/apigility-documentation),
and the apigility.org website consumes that documentation. To update the
documentation to display on the website, run:

```console
$ make documentation
```

and commit the `composer.lock` when done.

### Rendering Documentation

Since the documentation is written in GitHub Flavored Markdown, we use "fenced
code blocks," which provide us with the ability to specify the programming
language used in the code block in order to provide syntax highlighting.

Unfortunately, no Markdown libraries we found for PHP would perform the syntax
highlighting beyond a CSS class referring to the language.

This website solves the problem by identifying each fenced code block and the
syntax specified for it, and passing it to [pygmentize](http://pygments.org/).
This means the `pygmentize` executable needs to be available on the system
running the website.

If it is, and it is available at `/usr/bin/pygmentize`, you do not need to do
anything. If it is on any other path, add the following to your
`config/autoload/local.php` file (create it if it hasn't been):

```php
'pygmentize' => 'path/to/pygmentize'
```

Deployment
----------

To deploy, first use `zf-deploy` to package the zpk file:

```console
$ ./vendor/bin/zf-deploy.php build ../apigility.zpk --zpkdata zpk
```

Next, use the [Zend Server SDK](https://github.com/zend-patterns/ZendServerSDK)
to deploy the application; the following assumes that you know the application
ID and have properly setup a target for the Zend Server instance we deploy to:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationUpdate --appId=<id> --appPackage=../apigility.zpk --target=apigility
```

This will update the existing application, and clear cache rules.
